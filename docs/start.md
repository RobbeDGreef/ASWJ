Started looking for stl docs
 -> wikipedia
 -> reprap wiki

Started creating simple 3d objects
 -> cube
 -> box
 -> suzan

blender gives ascii

found site:
-> https://docs.fileformat.com/cad/stl/

most used fileformat is binary so that is what well write

each triangle are 12 32bit floating point numbers
